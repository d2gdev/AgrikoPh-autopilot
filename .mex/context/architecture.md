# Architecture

## System Overview

**Data ingestion path (cron-driven):**
External cron scheduler → `POST /api/cron/*` (Bearer `CRON_SECRET`) → `acquireJobLock` → job handler in `jobs/` → connector in `lib/connectors/` fetches data from Meta/GSC/GA4/Google Ads/Shopify → upserted as `RawSnapshot` rows in PostgreSQL → `run-skills` job loads `skills-source/*.md` prompts + sends snapshot payload to DeepSeek → parsed `Recommendation` rows written to DB.

**Operator review + execution path:**
Shopify admin iframe → Next.js App Router page (`app/(embedded)/`) → App Bridge session token → embedded API route (`app/api/`) → Prisma query → operator approves recommendation → `execute-approved` cron (only when `EXECUTE_APPROVED_LIVE_ENABLED=true`) → `lib/guardrails.ts` re-checks → live write to Meta Ads API or Shopify Admin API.

**Browser auth:** Embedded browser requests use Shopify App Bridge JWT bearer tokens; browser code must never receive or send `AUTOPILOT_API_KEY`. Embedded app routes call `requireAppAuth(req)` to validate the JWT. When the embedded app and Admin API token-refresh app differ, session verification uses `SHOPIFY_SESSION_API_KEY` / `SHOPIFY_SESSION_API_SECRET` while the Admin connector retains `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` / `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`. Trusted direct/scripted calls may use the server-only `X-Autopilot-Api-Key` header.

## Key Components

- **`jobs/`** — standalone job handler functions; each exports a `[name]Handler()` called by cron routes; writes a `JobRun` row and returns `JobResult<T>`
- **`lib/skills/`** — AI skill system: `loader.ts` reads `skills-source/*.md`, `runner.ts` calls DeepSeek, `orchestrator.ts` coordinates multi-skill runs and deduplicates recommendations
- **`lib/connectors/`** — per-platform data fetchers: `meta.ts`, `ga4.ts`, `gsc.ts`, `google-ads.ts`, `klaviyo.ts` (dead); each normalises raw API data into the `RawSnapshot` payload schema
- **`lib/guardrails.ts`** — safety layer on the execution path; `hard_block` prevents dangerous changes (large bid swings, pausing high-conversion campaigns without data); thresholds are DB-configurable with 5-min cache
- **`lib/auth.ts`** — three auth paths: `requireAppAuth` (App Bridge JWT), `requireCronAuth` (Bearer `CRON_SECRET`), `apiKeyMatches` (`X-Autopilot-Api-Key`)
- **`lib/job-lock.ts`** — DB-row-based advisory lock; prevents concurrent duplicate cron runs for the same job name
- **`lib/alerts.ts`** — fires webhook alerts (`ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`) on job failure, stale jobs, and data freshness gaps
- **`lib/content-pilot/`** — separate pipeline for blog content: `generate-proposals.ts` scores existing articles → `ContentProposal` rows → operator approves → draft generation via AI → publish to Shopify blog
- **`lib/market-intel/`** — competitor ad capture, shopping price history, keyword research; stored in `CompetitorAd`, `ShoppingResult`, `KeywordResearchResult` tables

## External Dependencies

External services accessed via HTTP/REST. Connectors live in `lib/connectors/`.

- PostgreSQL (via **prisma**) — only persistent store; all reads and writes go through `import { prisma } from "@/lib/db"`; never instantiate `PrismaClient` directly
- Meta Ads REST API — primary ad channel; reads (metrics) and writes (pause/budget changes); env: `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` + `META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID`
- Google Ads REST API (via **google-ads-api** package) — keyword research only; no campaign management writes; env: `GOOGLE_ADS_*`
- Google Analytics 4 + Search Console REST APIs (via **google-auth-library**) — Agriko's own analytics; service account JSON auth; env: `GA4_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` / `GSC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`
- Shopify Admin REST/GraphQL API (via **@shopify/shopify-api**) — blog articles, products, images; env: `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` server-side only
- DeepSeek OpenAI-compatible REST API (via **openai** SDK) — primary AI for skill runs; env: `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; model `deepseek-v4-flash`
- OpenRouter OpenAI-compatible REST API (via **openai** SDK) — AI fallback and legacy direct-analysis routes; env: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- Serper and DataForSEO REST APIs — Google Shopping intelligence for market intelligence; env: `SERPER_API_KEY`

## What Does NOT Exist Here

- No Google Ads campaign writes — Google Ads is read-only keyword data only; do not add campaign management
- No Klaviyo / Email Pilot — `lib/connectors/klaviyo.ts` exists but is dead code; treat as out of scope
- No built-in job scheduler — external cron on the VPS calls the `/api/cron/*` routes; the app itself does not schedule tasks
- No file storage abstraction — images handled directly via Shopify Admin API; no S3 or CDN layer

## Local Development Controller Boundary

`scripts/codex-agent-loop.mjs` is a local, file-backed development orchestrator, not part of the Next.js application or production job pipeline. In plan mode it runs one workspace-writing executor and one read-only planner sequentially, persists private evidence under `.codex-agent-loop/runs/`, and may roll over only through a configured finite number of iteration windows.

An approved plan authorizes bounded local implementation, verification, documentation, and commits only. Plan text never grants production access, deployment, live Shopify or Meta writes, production database changes, credential or permission changes, destructive actions, scope expansion, strategy activation, or material operator judgment. Those boundaries still produce `awaiting_user`; neither resume nor automatic window rollover weakens the configured Codex sandboxes.

Public status deliberately excludes objectives, prompts, plan source, model output, and operator answers. Plan-aware output is limited to the normalized plan path, task identifiers, iteration/window counters, evidence directory, approval metadata when paused, completion reason, and a validated commit identifier when final execution evidence supplies one.
